		<h3>Prepayment</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="span8">
		<p>Most student loans, including federal student loans, allow the borrower to prepay their loans without penalty. This means that any additional payment will reduce your total cost and help you pay your debt back faster. Some borrowers even prepay their entire loan before any interest has accrued. If you have non-federal loans, be certain to check with your lender to confirm that prepayment is penalty-free.</p>

		<h3>Consolidation</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="span8">
		<p><strong>Federal</strong></p>
		<p>To lower your monthly payment and simplify loan repayment, consider a Traditional Direct Consolidation Loan. Based on the amount of federal student loans you combine, you may be eligible for up to 30 years to repay your student loans. Direct Consolidation sets a fixed interest rate based on a weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of 1%, capped at 8.25%.</p>

		<p><strong>Private</strong></p>
		<p>Private consolidation loans are offered by banks and credit unions (not the Federal government) and are credit-based and generally require strong credit to be obtained. Most people take advantage of the Federal programs because they are having trouble managing their debt burden and a lower payment will help. If you also have private loan debt and you're struggling to make the payments and/or have weak credit, then it's unlikely you'll qualify for private consolidation.</p>
